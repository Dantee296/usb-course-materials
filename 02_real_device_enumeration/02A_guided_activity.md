##### Excercise

<i>Note: this is the only non-CTF-style exercise in the course, but it's super helpful to visualize this process on a consumer device.</i>

With Wireshark/USBMon running, plug in any USB device. If you don't have any USB devices with you, ask the instructors and we'll lend you something fun.

Look through the packets that were traced, and identify:
* The <i>vendor</i> and <i>product</i> IDs for the device.
* The device's active <i>configuration</i> and <i>interface description</i>.
* The endpoints used by the device.
