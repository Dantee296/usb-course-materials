##### Challenge

With a reputation thoroughly tarnished from several security disasters, <i>Industry Security Practices</i> (InSec Practices, Inc.) has decided to spin off their embedded electronics division into a new company, <i>Industry Security Devices</i> (InSec Devices, Inc).

As a first venture into the landscape, InSec has produced a new IoT broom-- which has all of the functionality of a normal broom, but which almost certainly promises to somehow stop beign useful for pushing dirt in a year or so, when InSec abandons their IoT ventures and ceases to provide the needed backend servers. <i>Hey, at least they didn't start with fire extinguishers.</i>

Not much is known about this device's communications\*, but it does have a small micro-USB port located on the back. Explore its firmware and see if you can convince it to misbehave. 

<i><small>\* for example, how the heck does it connect to the internet?
as far as you can tell, it has no on-board wireless **anything**.</small></i>
