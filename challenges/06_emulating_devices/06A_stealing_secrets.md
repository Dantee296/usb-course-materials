##### Challenge

After a successful debut in the IoT market--where security is all but irrelevant--<i>Industry Security Devices</i> (InSec Devices, Inc) has started a process of rapidly prototyping new products.

Over the course of this rapid development spin-up, several new files appeared on their public FTP server, including a suspicious file that appears to be a firmware updater for an unknown product.

Examine the relevant piece of software, and see if you can rapidly prototype hardware that interfaces with it. With enough interfacing, you may be able to find a firmware update!
