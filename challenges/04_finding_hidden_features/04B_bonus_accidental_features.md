##### Challenge

Despite several attempts at firewalling, <i>Industry Security Practices, Inc.</i> (InSec) has continued to suffer data thefts. Accordingly, they've upgraded to a brand-new architecture, which seems to integrate security features directly into their keyboards. 

You've been able to get your hands on the firmware for the microcontroller that powers the keyboards, but haven't been able to get any supporting driver software or documentation.

Continue exploring the InSec keyboard firmware and find the remaining flag!
